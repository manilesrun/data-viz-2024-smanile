Matilda Viz 2024 - A data visualisation competition

### Describing the story

This data visualization project aims to underscore mental health as the most critical health issue globally and in Australia. Despite its prevalence, many individuals do not seek professional help, with stigma and confidentiality concerns being the primary barriers to accessing support. Through this narrative, my goal is to raise awareness that addressing this issue goes beyond providing servicesâ€”it requires a fundamental shift in societal attitudes, breaking down stigmas, and fostering a culture where seeking help is embraced and normalized.

### Describing how visualization was made

This project is made using:

- React.js: to build the frontend interface
- Tableau: to viusalize the data
- R: to clean the raw data to a useful data
